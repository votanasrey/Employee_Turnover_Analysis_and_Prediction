# ML-Project-Employee-Turnover

# The Problem:

One of the most common problems at work is turnover. Replacing a worker earning about 50,000 dollars cost the company about 10,000 dollars or 20% of that workerâ€™s yearly income according to the Center of American Progress. Replacing a high-level employee can cost multiple of that...

# Cost include:
    Cost of off-boarding
    Cost of hiring (advertising, interviewing, hiring)
    Cost of onboarding a new person (training, management time)
    Lost productivity (a new person may take 1-2 years to reach the productivity of an existing person)

# Objective:

    To understand what factors contributed most to employee turnover.
    To perform clustering to find any meaningful patterns of employee traits.
    To create a model that predicts the likelihood if a certain employee will leave the company or not.
    To create or improve different retention strategies on targeted employees.
    
The implementation of this model will allow management to create better decision-making actions.
